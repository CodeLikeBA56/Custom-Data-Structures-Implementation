# Java Data Structures

This repository contains **manual implementations of common Data Structures in Java**.  
It was built as part of a **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** project in the 3rd semester.  

The purpose is to understand how data structures work internally and to improve **OOP concepts**.
